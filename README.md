# Spiffy with Giphy
A small project to practice AJAX GET requests using the Giphy API.


# To Do:
* (_X_) create an array of strings of topics I like (let topics)
* (_X_) iterate over topics and create buttons in your HTML.
* (_X_) <button> behaviour: 
    - get 10 static/non-animated imgs from GIPHY API
    - append to the page
    - rating below the img
* (_X_) <img> behaviour:
    - click to animate / stop animate
    - ~~toggle~~ on click replace last part of src string
* (_X_) Create a form element
    - input field
    - push value to array
    - append to div with new button.
* ensure http https is dealt with to ensure smooth deployment

# To Do Vee Two:
* I hate that I get the same first 10. Find a way to randomize. 
* The wonky layout bothers me. Fix that. 
* Add way to rate them.
